### Abstract

Modern web monopolies and proprietary platforms dominate the tools that billions of people depend on daily for business and personal use, while FOSS tools are used by a tiny sliver of the population. A big reason for this is likely to be the difficult user experiences that are laborious and oftentimes outright broken. How can FOSS ever compete against vastly funded proprietary companies with thousands of employees with sparse patches of funding and volunteer work. Open Source Design is a community that's exploring new models of sustainable funding that is focused into design-led improvements to open source software. 

### Description

The dream of living in a post-capitalistic, free and open society, where basic human rights and privacy are protected and people do work that is meaningful to them- a world where technology empowers and equalizes. Yet when looking at the current landscape and the worlds dependence on modern web monopolies and proprietary platforms, the inverse is true. These tools are oppressing and unbalancing society at a breakneck rate.

Even in the CCC crowd, many people depend on Facebook, Twitter, and Google Maps daily â€“ so why has the idealistic Free Software community been left in the dust by their "evil-ish" counterparts? One of the largest reasons the masses do not primarily use FOSS tools are not because of the ethics or freedom, but due to challenging interfaces & user experience issues.

One main reason for this is that these project lack sustainable funding and are only run by volunteers in their free time. The Open Source Design community thinks these problems go hand in hand and reinforce the lack of user adoption of viable freedom respecting alternatives. We have been exploring ideas of how to improve this situation while not compromising ethics and values of Free Software.

Jan has worked on the design of ownCloud (an open source file sync & share software) since it began, his work has helped the project gain massive user adoption of over 2 million users. There is also a company around ownCloud which sustainably employs over 60 people full-time.
Brennan is the designer of Mailpile, the well-known email app built on web technologies which aims to bring secure communication to the masses. They chose to fund their efforts using a crowd-funding campaign and succeeded in raising over 170k dollars to work on it full-time.

The ultimate goal we want to realize is to make intuitive and highly usable open source software for the masses while not losing the configurability and hackability that the open source community loves about open software. As a collective of designers, UX people, and engineers, we want to make sure technology is approachable and usable by more people.
